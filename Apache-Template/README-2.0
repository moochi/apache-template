this is the mod_perl 2.0 port for the Apache::Template module, based on
Apache::Template 0.09.  note that the big difference in userland for
this modules is that you need to use PerlLoadModule to load
Apache::Template in httpd.conf, not PerlModule:

  PerlLoadModule Apache::Template.

other than that, it should behave the same as with mod_perl 1.0, with
the caveats listed below.

outside of the new test suite, this module consists of the original
Apache::Template 0.09 code modified as little as possible with the
sole purpose of getting it to run under mod_perl 2.0.  in other words,
while the addition of the test suite exposed a few bugs in Apache::Template,
the bugs that were uncovered remain unfixed - this is a port, not a
rewrite.

also, keep in mind that I am not responsible for bugs or coredumps that may
occur as a result of the other packages this module depends upon, namely
mod_perl 2.0 and libapreq 2.0.  I am also not responsible for problems with
the logic of Apache::Template, such as its thread safety (or lack thereof) - 
at the moment, I get core dumps with the worker mpm under various conditions,
especially when running t/05ct.t by itself.  so, if you choose to use this
module it might be wise to stick with the prefork mpm.

this module will likely never reach CPAN for reasons that you can discover
if you google hard enough.

other than that, if you find any place where this port doesn't behave as 
it did under mod_perl 1.0 please let me know.  additional karma points to 
those that add test cases which work under mod_perl 1.0 but not 2.0.
