NAME
    Apache::Template - Apache/mod_perl interface to the Template Toolkit

SYNOPSIS
        # add the following to your httpd.conf
        PerlModule          Apache::Template

        # set various configuration options, e.g.
        TT2Trim             On
        TT2PostChomp        On
        TT2EvalPerl         On
        TT2IncludePath      /usr/local/tt2/templates
        TT2IncludePath      /home/abw/tt2/lib
        TT2PreProcess       config header
        TT2PostProcess      footer
        TT2Error            error

        # now define Apache::Template as a PerlHandler, e.g.
        <Files *.tt2>
            SetHandler      perl-script
            PerlHandler     Apache::Template
        </Files>

        <Location /tt2>
            SetHandler      perl-script
            PerlHandler     Apache::Template
        </Location>

DESCRIPTION
    The Apache::Template module provides a simple interface to the Template
    Toolkit from Apache/mod_perl. The Template Toolkit is a fast, powerful
    and extensible template processing system written in Perl. It implements
    a general purpose template language which allows you to clearly separate
    application logic, data and presentation elements. It boasts numerous
    features to facilitate in the generation of web content both online and
    offline in "batch mode".

    This documentation describes the Apache::Template module, concerning
    itself primarily with the Apache/mod_perl configuration options (e.g.
    the httpd.conf side of things) and not going into any great depth about
    the Template Toolkit itself. The Template Toolkit includes copious
    documentation which already covers these things in great detail. See
    Template and Template::Manual for further information.

INSTALLING Apache::Template
    The Apache::Template module is installed using the familiar incantation:

        $ perl Makefile.PL
        $ make
        $ make test
        # make install                  # as root

UPGRADING FROM EARLIER VERSIONS OF Apache::Template
    If you are upgrading from an earlier version of Apache::Template (e.g.
    0.08 or earlier) then you should pay particular attention to the changes
    in the TT2Headers option in version 0.09.

    The Content-Type header can now be controlled by the TT2Headers option
    (to enable or disable it) and by the TT2ContentType option (to set a
    specific Content-Type).

    If you don't specify any TT2Headers option, then it will default to
    sending the Content-Type header only, emulating the existing behaviour
    of Apache::Template 0.08 and earlier. Thus the default is equivalent to
    the following:

        TT2Headers      type              # default 

    If you do specify a TT2Headers option, then you must now explicitly add
    the 'type' value to have Apache::Template send the Content-Type header.

        TT2Headers      type length

    If you don't specify 'type' in the TT2Headers option then
    Apache::Template will not add a Content-Type header.

    The default value for Content-Type is 'text/html' but can now be changed
    using the TT2ContentType option.

        TT2ContentType  text/xml

CONFIGURATION

    options.
